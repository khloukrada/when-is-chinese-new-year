When is Lunar New Year?

Lunar New Year is the Chinese festival that celebrates the beginning of a new year on the traditional Chinese calendar.
Given that the Lunar New Year is based on the traditional Chinese lunisolar calendar, it falls on a different day on the Gregorian calendar each year.
This talk will show how to calculate the Gregorian calendar date of the Lunar New Year, as well as other holidays derived from the traditional Chinese calendar.
This talk will start with data about the position of the sun and moon, and use numpy, pandas, and NOVAS (Naval Observatory Vector Astrometry Software) to calculate the traditional Chinese lunisolar calendar.

While most people will not need to compute the Chinese lunisolar calendar, this talk will try to cover some of these more generally applicable topics:

- working with degrees and radians with numpy
- smoothing an array of noisy data
- finding local minima and maxima

This talk will likely need closer to 10 minutes to both set up the problem and show at least part of the solution.

The audience is not expected to know anything about the traditional Chinese lunisolar calendar before the talk.
The talk will use intermediate level Python.
This talk will assume some knowledge of numpy and pandas, but does not assume existing knowledge of NOVAS.
